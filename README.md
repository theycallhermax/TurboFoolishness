## Documentation
This is the place you would/had been brought to when you clicked on the "Open Documentation" button.
### Fetch
*This has been known to not work sometimes, returning `undefined`. Use at your own risk. Recommended usage is meant to connect to APIs (JSON)*

**Fetch** is a reporter made to connect to websites. As described above, Fetch is known not to work at times, and it's recomended usage is to connect to APIs. At this time, no built-in JSON extractors are included with TurboFoolishness. To extract it, you will need a seprate extension.

### Comment

The **Comment** block is made to have a reporter input, and since this is made to be a inline comment for ~~Scratch~~ TurboWarp and E羊icques, this block does absoluteley nothing.

### Join

**Join** is a reporter that is a join reporter, but with one more slot to enter in text. This was made to make the code smaller, and not requiring to resize it very small.

### Addition

**Addition** is a reporter, that is almost like the addition reporter with two user inputs, but has one more input for doing addition (+).

### Returns true/false/nothing?

**Returns true?** or **Returns false?** or **Returns nothing?** are booleans that returns true, for example, if it returns true. They all have boolean inputs that checks what the outside boolean returns.

#### Returns true?

**Returns true?** is a boolean that checks to see if the outside boolean returns true. If the outside boolean returns true, the boolean will return true as well, and if the outside boolean returns false, the boolean will return false as well.

#### Returns false?

**Returns false?** is a boolean that checks to see if the outside boolean returns false. If the outside boolean returns true, the boolean will return false, and if the outside boolean returns false, the boolean will return true.

#### Returns nothing?
*This boolean has a relationship with the deleted boolean `dummy boolean`. This boolean returns false all the time.*

**Returns nothing** is a boolean that checks to see if the outside boolean returns nothing at all. If the outside boolean returns nothing, then the boolean will return true, and if the boolean returns true or false or anything else (rare case), it will return false, meaning that most of the time, the boolean will return false.

### Miliseconds

**Miliseconds** is a reporter that returns the current miliseconds.

### And

**And** is a boolean that has one more input for booleans. It will return true when all of the booleans return true at the same time.
